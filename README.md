This is the quick demo of jQuery AJAX, JSONP and CORS that I gave at our Wednesday Whiteboard presentation 14th Feb.

It's currently the raw demo with hard-coded host names. The dynamic content is in the .ashx files, ASP.NET HTML handlers, since that's the technology I had to hand. To run these you'll need to host the files in IIS, IIS Express or the MSVC WebDev server. You can find the latter under 

C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DevServer\

on a default install.

To do:
* Unify the three demos into one file - it made sense to evolve the presentation but less needed here
* Update to dynamically generate the URLs rather than use hard-coded machine names
* Make more presentable
* and probably more too
